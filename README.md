# PySide6 App Framework Library

### Overview
This library aims to address gaps in PySide6 for creating advanced applications. While PySide6 is robust, features such as **dynamic settings**, **in-app notifications**, and **standardized project structure** are often difficult to implement without custom solutions. This framework is designed to streamline these processes, offering developers a consistent and efficient way to build applications.

You can think of this library as a framework to **standardize and simplify application development**, especially for dynamic, feature-rich projects.

### Features
- **Dynamic Settings**  
  Easily manage and update application settings within the app. Configurations can adapt to changes in a JSON file.  
- **Notifications Module**  
  Integrate notification pop-ups or in-app notification pages with dynamic content updates.  
- **Standardized Application Structure**  
  Provides a foundation for app organization to reduce development time and ensure consistency.  
- **Project Management Tools**  
  Built-in tools for managing modular components or app-specific data.  
- **Theme Management**  
  Easily apply and switch between themes to customize your app's appearance.

### Future Plans
1. **Data Visualization Module**  
   Simplify the addition of real-time updating graphs and visual components.

### Current Status
This library is in the **early stages of refactoring**. A previous version exists, but it is being redesigned for greater flexibility and modularity. Contributions and feedback are welcome as development progresses.  

Stay tuned for updates as the framework evolves into a comprehensive solution for PySide6-based applications.
